# Task Categorization Overview

Your tasks are organized into four main categories, each with specific purposes and scoring rules:

**1. Main Tasks**
**2. Personal Tasks**
**3. Basic Tasks**
**4. Routines**

**1. Main Tasks**

These tasks are the core focus areas, involving Work and Study activities.

Work: Divided into various durations, e.g., 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, etc., with associated points.
Example: Working for 2 hours earns 5 points.

Study: I have divided studying into 2 parts: Watching lectures and Self-studying. Similarly, I have broken it into time blocks, such as 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, etc.
Example: Studying for 1 hour earns 3 points.

**Important Rule: Only the longest block completed is counted for points.**
Example: If Cato works for 2 hours, they get 5 points (not 1+3+5 = 8).

**2. Personal Tasks**
These tasks are related to self-care, exercise, planning, and cleaning.

Self-Care: Includes activities like meditation, reading (self-help/novels/audiobooks), and journaling.
Each task is subdivided into time options (e.g., 5 minutes = 1 point, 60 minutes = 6 points).

Exercise: Includes walking, yoga, gym, or stretching, each with points based on duration.

Cleaning: Tasks like cleaning your room, and washing clothes, or utensils, each with time-based points.

Planning: Time spent planning for the next day or morning also earns points.

**3. Basic Tasks**
These are simple daily personal hygiene tasks.
Examples:
Under 5 minutes: Brushing, washing your face, skincare, or quick stretches (0.2 points each).
Under 10 minutes: Take a bath, use the restroom(2 number), or update your to-do list (0.5 points each).
**Important** - 
Tasks done under 5 minutes - You can count them numerous times daily.

Tasks done under 10 minutes—You can count certain tasks, like Bathing, WC, and updating your goals, only once a day.

**4. Routines**
These are structured sequences of tasks that must be completed in one go.

Morning Routine: Tasks include brushing, freshening up, breakfast, and taking medication.
Example: Bathing in the morning earns 0.5 points; skipping it gives only 0.2 points.

Afternoon Routine: Includes meditation, short walks, and lunch.

Night Routine: Tasks include brushing, medication, skin care, dinner, and planning for the next day.

**Important Rule: Points are awarded only if the routine is followed strictly (tasks done consecutively).**

## General Notes on Scoring

- Tasks are generalized into time blocks so individuals can choose their preferred approach.
  
- Points are awarded per category based on the longest time block completed.
  Example: If you meditate for 30 minutes (3 points) and read for 10 minutes (1 point), only 3 points are counted from Self-Care.
  
- This system encourages a balance between structured routines, personal care, and productivity while maintaining flexibility for individual preferences.
  

## Examples of How Scoring Works

1. **Work (Main Category)**
  For an entire day, If you worked for 2 hours, you earned 5 points (from the 2-hour block).
  If you worked for 30 minutes and then 60 minutes, you only earn points for the 60-minute block (3 points).

**<u>I have purposely skipped 1.5 hrs to push you a bit, if you are in flow 30 minutes won’t mind much.</u>**

2. **Study (Main Category)**
  

- If you self-studied for 90 minutes, you earn 4 points (from the 90-minute block).
  
- If you self-studied for 15 minutes, 45 minutes, and then 2 hours, you count only the 2-hour block (6 points).
  
- If you self-studied for 45 minutes and then watched a lecture for 2 hours, you count 2pts + 3pts, respectively.
  

3. **Self-Care (Personal Category)**
  

- If you meditated for 10 minutes and read for 5 minutes. You will get 4 points for meditation ( and not 2 + 4) and 0.5 pts for reading.
  
- If you meditated for 30 minutes, journaled(Writing your thoughts), and walked for 15 minutes, you get 8 pts + 5 + 1 = 14 pts
  

4. **Personal Hygiene (Basic Category)**

- If you brush, wash your face, and eat your breakfast you get 0.2 + 0.2 + 0.2 = 0.6 pts. (All the tasks under 5 minutes)
  
- If you bathe, go to 2 numbers, and update your todo/goals you get 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 = 1.5 pts. (All the tasks under 10 minutes)
  

**Tasks done under 5 minutes - You can count them numerous times daily.**

**Tasks done under 10 minutes - For certain tasks like Bathing, wc & updating your goals you can count them only once a day.**

5. **Routines (Routine Category)**

Routines are an exception. You must complete all tasks in the routine in one go to earn points, and partial completion doesn’t count for full points.

# Key Takeaways

- <u>One Block Per Subcategory(& Sub-Subcategory)</u>: Choose your longest completed block in each subcategory for scoring.
  
- <u>No Combining Blocks</u>: You can’t combine smaller time blocks for a higher score.
  
- <u>Encourages Focus</u>: This rule motivates individuals to commit to longer, uninterrupted sessions of work, study, or self-care.
  

This makes the system fair, focused, and easy to track progress without overlap.

**Basic Task’s low points Explanation. **

For Basic Tasks, I have intentionally assigned low points to ensure fairness. Some individuals can complete these tasks naturally without needing a to-do list, while others may require more effort and reminders to accomplish them. Keeping the points low, levels the playing field—those who don’t need extra support can skip these tasks without a significant impact on their overall score, while those who struggle with them can still earn points for their efforts. This approach ensures the system remains balanced and fair for everyone.
